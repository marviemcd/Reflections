When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When multiple people are working on it, or when you have a production version of your project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Pull changes manually when you know the changes are ready and complete. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Clone is a copy of a GitHub or local repository on your local computer.
	Fork is a copy of someone else's GitHub repositoy on your GitHub account.
	You would use Fork when you want your own version of someone else's GitHub repository where you can make your own changes.  You would use Clone to copy a repository to your local computer.
	Branch is a new version of code that you want to keep separate from master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	Easier to see differences between that copy and your changes, and then other people's changes.  Best to be working on most recent remote copy.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Manual collaboration would be harder than using Git/GitHub, especially when more than two people may be involved.
